        "In machine learning and Python programming, a parameter refers to a variable that is part of a model or function and is used to control its behavior. There are two main types of parameters in this context:\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Parameters: These are the internal variables that are learned from the training data during the training process. For example, in a linear regression model, the coefficients (weights) and the intercept are parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function Parameters: These are variables defined in the function signature and are passed into functions to control their execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s go over both kinds of parameters with code examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Model Parameters in Machine Learning\n",
        "In machine learning, parameters are the internal variables that the algorithm learns during training. For example, in linear regression, the weights and bias are parameters that the model adjusts to minimize the error.\n",

        "Example: Model Parameters in Linear Regression\n",
        "python\n",
        "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",

        "X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])\n",

        "What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It quantifies how one variable changes in relation to another. The correlation coefficient, often denoted as r, ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Positive correlation: When one variable increases, the other variable also increases. (e.g., height and weight)\n",

        "Zero correlation: There is no predictable relationship between the two variables.\n",

        "Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
        "r = 1: Perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases proportionally).\n",
        "r = -1: Perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally).\n",
        "r = 0: No correlation (there is no predictable relationship between the variables).\n",
        "What does Negative Correlation Mean?\n",
        "Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, or as one variable decreases, the other increases. The closer the correlation coefficient is to -1, the stronger the negative relationship.\n",
